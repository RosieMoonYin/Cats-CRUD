# Full Stacking!

It's time to get started working with both C# , HTML, CSS and Javascript!

## Info

You have been supplied with a bare-bones full-stack project.
Today, the stage is yours. Work on [vertical slices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_slice) to build up your application and add functionality! 

What to add? That is up to you! You can focus on impementing some basic [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) on the backend! Setup styling in the frontend or implement som interactivity with JavaScript!

## Getting started.

1. Make sure you have NPM installed.
  - If you are on Mac or Linux, install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) here and set your version to 20.
  - If you are on Windows, do the same but install the [Windows verson of nvm](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

## Running the Project

Run the following command to get started

  ```shell
  npm start
  ```
This starts both the front-end and back-end at the same time!

Happy Hacking!
